  1:
    english: |
      Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
      That saved a wretch like me
      I once was lost but now am found
      Was blind but now I see
  2:
    english: |
      It was Grace that taught
      My heart to fear
      And Grace my fears relieved
      How precious did that Grace appear
      The hour I first believed
  3:
    english: |
      My chains are gone, I have been set free
      My God, my Saviour has ransomed me
      And like a flood His mercy rains
      Unending love, Amazing Grace
  4:
    english: |
      The Lord has promised good to me
      His word my hope secures
      He will my shield and portion be
      As long as life endures
  5:
    english: |
      The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
      The sun forbear to shine
      But God who called me here below
      Will be forever mine
      Will be forever mine
      You are forever mine
